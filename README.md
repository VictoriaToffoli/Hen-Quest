# 🐔 Hen's Quest

Hen's is an engaging game that puts you in the feathers of a distressed mother hen searching for her lost chicks. At each level, your mission is to locate all the missing chicks and bring them safely to the nest. But beware, foxes lurk nearby, ready to chase you if you get too close! Collect delicious watermelon slices to gain a temporary speed boost and outmaneuver the cunning foxes.
